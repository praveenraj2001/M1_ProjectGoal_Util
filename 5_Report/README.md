# Math calculator Report
---
## Design Thinking Process
 * **Empathize**  Here all the information is gathered about the problem of making a calculator
 * **Define** The use of calculator is widely involved in presicion calculators but when we use mobilephones and webapplications they tend to be more unreliable so the use of computer based calculator is the main defination of this project
 * **Ideate** Here the brainstorming ideas are born for making an idea to make a simple but presicion calculator
 * **Prototype** This is the prototype of the project
 * **Test** The math calculator is Tested and verified with the outputs *see 4_TestPlanAndOutput* for test

 * Documentation is also done for the project with Doxygen
 * All Codacy, Codiga, Unity, Dynamic Check, Static Check, Linux build

 #### **Implementation is done and the file runs succesfully**

#### **The Architecture  (Behavioural, Structural) both high and low level is also created**
